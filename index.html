    <h2>Nature</h2>
    <p>When we talk about nature then we will be exploring both our internal and external
        environment.As we all know nature is diverse.Birds are made of diffrence species and the behave 
        diffrently in our natural environment.There are some birds that fly miles away 
        in such of food and water.Some fly in groups while others fly as individuals.
        Most importantly is that we should take good care of nature.This is simply
        because they make part of our surroundings.When we talk about ocean life
        then we will get to know the diversity in there.We have different species of fish and ocean plants.We should therefore not pollute this waters for they save some major roles 
        that we might not know unless we take a deep glimps about nature.
